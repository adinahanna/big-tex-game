#Feed Big Tex

##Description
Feed Big Tex is a matching game with a State Fair of Texas theme. The game is simple: make card matches to win the game. At the beginning of each round, a random number of fair visitors generate. The player must make matches to equal the number of fair visitors. 

##Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS: flexbox
3. JavaScript: loops, arrays, callback functions, DOM manipulation

##Challenges I Faced 
This is the first game I've built start to finish for the browser. I quickly learned how important the planning process was - I thought I had planned fairly well, but there were definitely things I didn't think through clearly enough and that is reflected in my code. I think my code can be clearer and more concise. Future plans for this game definitely include refactoring.

##Features to Add in the Future
1. populate funnel cakes in the funnel cake counter div as the player creates matches
2. interaction/animation to the Big Tex image
3. card flip animation
4. more responsive styling and appropriate CSS for mobile play
